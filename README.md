# Personal projects and hobbies

Most of these projects are unfinished, but I am still proud to show these projects since they took quite some time and effort. I have learned a lot doing these projects and I am happy to show what I have learned. 
<br />
<br />
[Github Profile](https://github.com/katinas15) - most of my projects are here (some projects shown here are in private repositories).

## Simple Unity C# games

I recetly completed an online course learned how to use Unity and make games. The games I made are simple and unfinished, but they are a great start for me.
<br />

<b>Block Hopper</b> - is my most recent project. This is a project I intend to finish by myself and release someday. Most difficult challenge for me was creating pixel art rather than programming. Learning art is a completely different experience for me, but with a lot of time I finally grasped the basics of how to make something decent (at least for me).

<b>Labyrinth crawler</b> - was a group project for my university, I was responsible of programming the game. Main goal of the game is to find a way out of the labyrinth using various tool and fighting simple enemies. This was my first real project after completing the online course.

## Websites

After learning how to make websites and create web designs I was able to make a little bit of money by making few simple static websites.

## Java

One of my bigger projects in university was a to do list made in java using various technologies like:
* Hibernate
* Spring MVC
* Android

<br />
This is a more complex to do list that has users, project, tasks and companies. Projects can have users and tasks, companies can have users and projects. It is more like a group project management system, where every user in the project (or company) can see tasks, finish them, edit, create etc. This project has a dektop application, Web server and an Android application.
